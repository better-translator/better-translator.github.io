    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: December 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Ultimate Translate</strong>. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application. <strong>We do not require users to create an account or provide personal registration information.</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Since we do not have a registration system, we do not collect personal identifiers such as your name, email address (unless you contact us), or phone number. However, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Translation Content:</strong> To provide translation services, the text, images, or audio you input are processed by our servers and third-party AI engines.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, IP address, and unique device identifiers (e.g., IDFA, AAID).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the app, such as features used, language preferences, and crash logs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Delivery:</strong> To perform the translations you request using advanced AI models.</li>
        <li><strong>Product Improvement:</strong> To analyze app performance and improve translation accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Training Policy:</strong> We do not use your personal translation data to train our AI models without your explicit consent. Most data is processed ephemerally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Providers</h2>
    <p>To provide high-quality AI translations, we use trusted third-party service providers (such as OpenAI, Google Cloud, or DeepL). Your translation content is sent to these providers securely. These partners are prohibited from using your data for any purpose other than providing the translation service to us.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not store your translation history on our servers longer than necessary to process the request. Your translation history is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>, and you can delete it at any time by clearing the history or uninstalling the app.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard SSL/TLS encryption to protect your data during transmission. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our services are not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect identifiable data from children.</p>
